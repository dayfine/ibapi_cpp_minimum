# A Minimum Example of Connecting to Interactive Broker API in CPP

Because the official example in the [downable API](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/#) is full of nonsense...

This cuts a lot of unnecessary codes in the official TestClient and focus on what's the minimum amoumt of code needed (with missing functionalities).

## Prerequisite

-   Enable API access in TWS or use IB Gateway as [offical doc suggested](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/initial_setup.html)
